My name is Nick Howell. I'm a Sysadmin for Redgate in Cambridge, UK mostly working on virtualisation, storage, networking and other vaguely infrastructure things. 

Sometimes I take photos which you can find on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/nickhowell){:target="_blank"} or [Instagram](https://instagram.com/njhowell54){:target="_blank"}.
