My name is Nick Howell. I'm a Systems Administrator for [Redgate](https://www.red-gate.com). Most of my time at work is spent on virtualisation (Vmware and Openstack), networking and maintaining our Windows and Linux servers. I spend a lot of my time working in [Puppet](https://www.puppetlabs.com) and we firmly believe that [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) is the way forward. 

At home I'm a husband and father. On the rare occasion when I have some spare time, I can usually be found taking photos ([Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/nickhowell){:target="_blank"} \| [Instagram](https://instagram.com/njhowell54){:target="_blank"}) or tinkering with something computer related.
