I consider myself to be quite lucky. Every employee at Redgate gets a 6 week paid sabbatical every 5 years they've been working there. I've just taken mine. 

What you do is up to you, and many people I work with go off and travel the world somewhere. I opted for the slightly cheaper version, and took the opportunity to do all those jobs around the house that you never normally have time to do. 

My first week was a genuine actual holiday. We spent a week in Cornwall where it rained 5 out of 7 days, but was otherwise lovely. 

The next 5 weeks were all DIY. 

The Laminate flooring that we bought 2 years ago finally went down in the bathroom, along with new light fitting and towel rails. There was also a small amount of excitement while I fixed a leak that happened to occur at the same time.

The Garage got some love and had some new shelves and ladder hooks installed as well as a good tidy. 

Shelves were put under the stairs to make it less of dumping ground, and there was even a new curtain pole put up in the bedroom. 

We decorated the hall, stairs and landing. Which seemed like a great idea at the time, but quickly got out of hand when I started doing all the gloss work. 

Annoyingly, the pond pump when pop at some point during this time, so that also had to be replaced with a bigger and better one. I took the opportunity to clean the filter out as well which was...messy.

I moved my server up into the loft so give us a bit of floor space back in the office. That has largely gone well, except for the odd power cut where the PowerOn after AC loss function in the BIOS didn't work properly. 

I even found some time to move this blog from Ghost to Jekyll, and onto a new VM on Linodes $5 tier. 

Digitising the VHS tape collection is finally complete as well....but then I thought it would be a good idea to make "digital backups" of my DVD and BluRay collection as well....so that's still on going. 

I also managed to find some time to construct a home dashboard out of an old monitor and a Raspberry Pi.
