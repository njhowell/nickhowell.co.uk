My name is Nick Howell. I'm a Systems Administrator for <a href='https://www.red-gate.com' target='_blank'>Redgate</a>. Most of my time at work is spent on virtualisation (Vmware and Openstack), 
networking and maintaining our Windows and Linux servers. I spend a lot of my time working in <a href='https://www.puppet.com' target='_blank'>Puppet</a> -- we believe that 
infrastructure as code is the way forward and wherever possible use tools like <a href='https://www.puppet.com' target='_blank'>Puppet</a>, <a href='https://www.terraform.io/' target='_blank'>Terraform</a> and <a href='https://github.com/puppetlabs/razor-server' target='_blank'>Razor</a> to automate our infrastructure.

At home I'm a husband and father. On the rare occasion when I have some spare time, I can usually be found taking photos (<a href='https://flickr.com/photos/nickhowell' target='_blank'>Flickr</a>|<a href='https://instagram.com/njhowell54' target='_blank'>Instagram</a>) 
or tinkering with something computer related.

This site is a place for me to share some things I've learnt, or otherwise found interesting.
