`puppet-foldingathome` is a [puppet](https://puppet.com){:target="_blank"} module for installing and configuring the [folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/){:target="_blank"} client on linux systems.

Get the module from Github [njhowell/puppet-foldingathome](https://github.com/njhowell/puppet-foldingathome){:target="_blank"}

The module was written to allow me to quickly spin up a few VMs at work to run the Folding@Home client to donate some spare compute power to the Covid-19 research. You can read about it [here]({% post_url 2020-04-02-Folding-At-Redgate %}).
