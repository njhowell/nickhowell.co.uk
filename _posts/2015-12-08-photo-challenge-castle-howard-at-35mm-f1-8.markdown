We took a trip this weekend to [Castle Howard](http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/) near York for their [Christmas event](http://www.castlehoward.co.uk/house-and-grounds/christmas.html). I decided it would be a good opportunity to use my 35mm prime lens that has be been buried in my bag for the better part of a year!

I thought I'd set myself the challenge of using it all day without swapping to another lens, and (to further complicate it) keep it at F1.8 the whole time. I let the camera automatically select shutter speed, and I did find myself manually adjusting ISO on occasions where it was a bit dark inside the house.

You can see the results embedded below, or you can head straight to [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/nickhowell/sets/72157661558961670). I'm quite pleased with how most of them turned out :)
