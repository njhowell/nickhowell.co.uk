I was watching [this video](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2014/DCIM-B318#fbid=) of a session from TechEd on PowerShell earlier this week and I decided that I really should learn PowerShell properly and make use of it more. So, with that in mind, I'm going to make a point of using PowerShell wherever I can at work, and in the process hopefully learn a few things that I'll post here.



Today's discovery is actually from the aforementioned video. In PowerShell ISE, if you press ctrl+j you are presented with a list of snippets that you can insert.

I never knew this existed before, and I really wish I had. I'm a particular fan of the cmdlet snippet, and the foreach snippet, the syntax for which I can never remember.
